# mailanalyzer
Mail Analyzer GLPI Plugin aims at keeping track of email conversations.
It will combine emails from the same conversation into one Ticket.

It is currently tested with GLPI 0.83.8, 0.85.5, 0.90, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5 and 10.0

Must be copied into *glpifolder*/plugins/mailanalyzer

To be installed and enabled via the plugins configuration page in GLPI.

It creates a new table in the DB with the purpose of storing email guid (generated by email servers) in order to be able (if possible) to match emails in mailgate which have been sent using 'CC' and 'Reply to all'.
It cannot keeps track of forwarded emails and replies to them.

This solves the problem of duplicated Tickets when an email is sent to GLPI and CC (carbon copy) to others. And when those CC users use 'Reply to All', GLPI by default will create a new ticket. See: http://glpi.userecho.com/topic/1090667-new-rule-criteria-for-mail-receivers/
